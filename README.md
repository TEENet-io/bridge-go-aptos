## Problems:

- [ ] BTC lastblock height is not fetched in db, but using the "latest" height on the BTC Chain it is viewing.
- [ ] BTC components doesn't use ctx as stop signal, better use for graceful shutdown.
- [ ] Unused code in project. Use tool (staticcheck or golangci-lint) to find and remove them, or remove them manually.
- [ ] Eth side `Id` field of type `MonitoredTx` is used of different purposes, shall separate. not REUSED.
- [x] `ethtxmanager.MonitoredTx`:`sentAfter` breaks the monitor logic. <Level-0> bug. The last block hash is stored. However, in real life (not sim), the blck hash is not search-able. So better using last block height (int64) as a back up of hash. This now breaks the logic of finding expired Txs in local geth (regtest mode), but doesn't affect Sepolia Testnet or SimEtherman.
- [x] Automatic `ImportPrivateKeyRescan` and `ImportAddressRescan` on BTC node (regardless of local private node or regtest node) to tell BTC node wallet to track on specific address. Otherwise the BTC RPC node will not track the address (so our rpc balance / utxo query will return empty).
- [x] Need more config fileds in YAML of on server config to prevent new-deploy of smart contracts, use the existing smart contracts.
- [ ] Move Btc Regtest mining function to automatic step, no need for users to mine manually.
- [x] View Balance of btc/eth user shall contain address.
- [ ] Remove hard coded redeem fee: `BTC_TX_FEE` (btctxmanager/withdraw.go) = 0.001, `SAFE_MARGIN` (btcvault/vault.go) = 0.001.
- [ ] ETH side: synchronizer shall start not from 0 but from  a predefined block height, if not the last block height (if db is empty)
- [ ] ETH side: "state missing" latest chain id (1337) + latest block (start from 0), shall we start from a specific number, to avoid full-scan of blockchain (like after the blk of deployment block of bridge/twbtc smart contract)?
- [ ] Estimate BTC Tx fee (vbyte) based on the network! 1000 sat = 3.79v (in deposit)
- [ ] Make btc_finalized_number / BTC_MATURE_OFFSET a configurable int. (now uses 1 or 0)
- [x] ETH sync: shows prematurely "stopping Eth synchronization" in sepolia environment. must have some problems. - problem was rpc node doesn't support method "eth_getlogs" and existed prematurely. So we use a more robust node instead.
- [x] BTC new config: forceStartBlk, trigger birige scan from this blk, not newest, nor from 0 blk.
- [ ] BTC Deposit Action didn't log the sender. (probably log the Tx sender)
```
Bitcoin transactions do not include a dedicated "sender" field. Instead, every input in a transaction spends an output from a previous transaction. This means:

- There is no single sender address; if multiple inputs are used, there could be multiple originating addresses.
- To infer the sender(s), you must look up each input's referenced previous output and then derive the address from the locking script.
- For common types (e.g. P2PKH), you can often extract the public key hash from the inputâ€™s signature script, but this involves parsing the script and is not as straightforward as an explicit field.

So, in your loop through block.Transactions, you'll need to inspect each transaction's inputs and perform additional lookups or script parsing if you want to determine the originating addresses.
